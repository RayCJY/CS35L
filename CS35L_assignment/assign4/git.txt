When we clone a repository from GitHub by default without specifying any branches, it clones only the default branch. This is the branch that is checked out and marked with an asterisk (*) when we run the command: git branch in the cloned repository.

The repository at ~eggert/src/github/git likely contains every branch because it is used for development. It will store every change and retain the history of Git, including all the feature and development branches created throughout its evolution.
